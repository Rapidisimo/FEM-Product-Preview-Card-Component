## My process
This was my second time using FrontEnd Mentor I decided to use the downloadable JPG version (tiny previews). My objective was to get as close to the design as possible using basic HTML and CSS.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The more you practice the faster you get!

### Continued development

I'd like to tackle bigger projects!
