## My process
Since this was my first time using FrontEnd Mentor I decided to use the downloadable JPG version. My objective was to get as close to the design as possible using basic HTML and CSS.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Because I didn't have access to the figma or sketch files I feel that the project could have turned out better. But my main objective was just to practice HTML and CSS so I'm happy with that. 


### Continued development

In future projects I want to make more use of flexbox alongside grid. Also it would be beneficial to start things off with Sass.
